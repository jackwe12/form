This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a react app followed by following rules:

1. Use React.js and no library(eg: Material UI, Bootstrap) for demostrating personal skill only.
2. Use Jest and Enzyme for unit testing.
3. Use responsive web design adapt from smallest screen(Iphone5) to desktop screen.
4. Use React new feature -hooks for demostrating more clean and maintainable code(reusable).
5. Modal, form-validation, form components are all written from plain React.js
